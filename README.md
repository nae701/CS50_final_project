# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Solving the Harvard Maze

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to find the floor plans of major buildings on campus

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will let you search for different floor plans of important buildings on campus, such as the upperclass Houses, academic buildings such as the
Science Center. These floor plans would allow you to find the location of classrooms, restrooms, dorm rooms, and exits for instance. From my research, I
have been unable to find a centralized system that contains these useful floor plans. Not only will my project help by agreggating these floor plans, another feature
will be the ability for the user to search by name the floor plans they want. This will be executed by storing the PDFs or JPGs of the floor plans in a database, and
access them based on what the user searched.


## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create a database that stores all the floor plans

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Suggest relevant floor plans based on users' GPS coordinates

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Show multiple first floor plans that are near each other at the same time in a viewer.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I need to acquire a lot of floor plans for various buildings. I will need to learn how to store these files (or perhaps just the file path) in a SQL database.
I will have to think about how to structure these tables effectively in order to search them efficiently. I will also need to learn how to get the GPS coordinates
of a user perhaps using some API, and compare it with the GPS coordinates of some reference point in the floor plans.
