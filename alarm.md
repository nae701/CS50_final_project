# False Alarm

## Questions

2.1. The list includes both drill and real alerts in the same dropdown menu. A better UI would separate the drill items clearly away from the real items

2.2. The human is still at fault (though really it is a combination), since they must be execrising extreme caution when handling such important systems

2.3a. Use two different select menus, one for drill alarms and one for real alarms

2.3b. Use CSS selectors, such as class to style the drill alarms in black font and the real alarms in red font

2.3c. Use the popup alert function that asks the user if they are sure they want to conduct a real alarm, but no alert for a drill alarm

2.4. To keep a log of all alarms selected through the UI

2.5. They would first have to select the real alarm menu. They would have to see the red font of the real alarm items, and upon selecting one
 they would have to click ok to remove the alert, which would then result in a real alarm being sounded on accident.
