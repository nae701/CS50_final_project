# Wonderful Queue

## Questions

10.1. Using an array for a queue instead of a linked list allows for very fast processes since
arrays have random access to any element. This allows you to add items to the end of the queue
quickly.

10.2. Using a linked list for a queue instead of an array means you don't have to specify
the size of the queue beforehand. This is especially useful in C since the programmer has to
deal with memory allocation issues more often than other languages.

10.3. Python allows you to create lists without specificying a length, while still maintaining
random access to all of the list elements. This gives you both of the benefits described above.

10.4. Although Python makes it easier to implement a queue, C makes it much faster since the
programmer has to deal with the lower level details such as memory allocation that Python does
automatically. Due to this, implementing a queue is simply faster in C, also because its a compiled language instead
of interpreted.

10.5.

Enqueue a shirt: q.append(s)
